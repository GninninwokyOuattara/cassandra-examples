= Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a problem with Cassandra, the first places to ask for
help are the `user mailing list
<mailing-lists>` and the `cassandra` `Slack room <slack>`.

If, after having asked for help, you suspect that you have found a bug
in Cassandra, you should report it by opening a ticket through the
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA[Apache Cassandra JIRA].
Please provide as much details as you can on your problem, and don't
forget to indicate which version of Cassandra you are running and on
which environment.

Further details on how to contribute can be found at our
`development/index` section. Please note that the source of this
documentation is part of the Cassandra git repository and hence
contributions to the documentation should follow the same path.
