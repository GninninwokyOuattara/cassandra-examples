You are given some sample data about various catfoods that can be purchased at the store. You
are looking to purchase the cheapest, but best food you can for the local shelter. The query you have is:
Which brand of catfood can I buy if I want the flavor "chicken", priced between $1.25 and $1.55? 
Have it list the answer in order of can_price from least to most.

Design the table that will allow you to make this query. Your table will be checked with a different 
set of data to see if the query will work. Use the following column names: brand, type, flavor, can_price, 
item_id, can_volume. Call the table "catfood".
