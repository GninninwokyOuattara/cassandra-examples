= Triggers

Triggers are identified by a name defined by:

[source,bnf]
----
trigger_name ::= identifier
----

[[create-trigger-statement]]
== CREATE TRIGGER

Creating a new trigger uses the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement:

[source,bnf]
----
create_trigger_statement ::= CREATE TRIGGER [ IF NOT EXISTS ] trigger_name 
				ON table_name  
				USING string
----

For instance:

[source,cql]
----
CREATE TRIGGER myTrigger ON myTable USING 'org.apache.cassandra.triggers.InvertedIndex';
----

The actual logic that makes up the trigger can be written in any Java
(JVM) language and exists outside the database. You place the trigger
code in a `lib/triggers` subdirectory of the Cassandra installation
directory, it loads during cluster startup, and exists on every node
that participates in a cluster. The trigger defined on a table fires
before a requested DML statement occurs, which ensures the atomicity of
the transaction.

[[drop-trigger-statement]]
== DROP TRIGGER

Dropping a trigger uses the `DROP TRIGGER` statement:

[source,bnf]
----
drop_trigger_statement ::= DROP TRIGGER [ IF EXISTS ] trigger_nameON table_name
----

For instance:

[source,cql]
----
DROP TRIGGER myTrigger ON myTable;
----
